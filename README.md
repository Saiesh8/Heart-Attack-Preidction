❤️ Heart Attack Prediction using Machine Learning
A predictive system built using machine learning to assess the likelihood of a heart attack based on clinical features like age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more. This project aims to assist in early diagnosis and preventive care.

🧠 Project Objective
To build a model that predicts whether a patient is at risk of a heart attack using a dataset of clinical indicators. This tool can assist doctors or health applications in identifying high-risk individuals for early intervention.

🚀 Key Features
🔢 Takes 13+ clinical inputs (e.g., age, chest pain type, cholesterol, etc.)

✅ Predicts heart attack risk (yes/no)

📊 Visualizes correlations and feature importance

📈 Trained and tested with ML algorithms: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, KNN, SVM

🧪 Accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix shown

⚙️ Tech Stack
Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

ML Models: Logistic Regression, KNN, Random Forest, SVM

Optional Frontend: Streamlit / Flask for UI
